## Convolutional Neural Network
A convolutional neural network (CNN or convnet) is a subset of machine learning. It is one of the various types of artificial neural networks which are used for different applications and data types. A CNN is a kind of network architecture for deep learning algorithms and is specifically used for image recognition and tasks that involve the processing of pixel data.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, X-ray diagnosis systems play a crucial role in modern medicine, providing a safe and non-invasive way to examine the internal structures of a patient's body for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. These systems utilize X-ray radiation to produce images of the body's internal structures, which can help healthcare professionals identify and diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, such as broken bones, lung diseases, and digestive system disorders.
